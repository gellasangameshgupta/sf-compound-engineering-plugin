# Salesforce Compound Engineering Plugin

A Claude Code plugin that makes each unit of Salesforce engineering work easier than the last. Transform how you plan, build, and review Salesforce solutions using AI-powered tools that systematically improve your development workflow.

## What Is Salesforce Compound Engineering?

**Each unit of Salesforce work should make subsequent units of work easier—not harder.**

Traditional Salesforce development accumulates technical debt:
- Triggers without proper handler patterns
- Flows that bypass governor limits understanding
- LWC components with duplicated logic
- Hardcoded IDs and magic numbers
- Missing test coverage for edge cases

Compounding engineering inverts this. Each feature you build:
- Documents patterns for the next feature
- Creates reusable components that accelerate future work
- Establishes conventions that reduce decision fatigue
- Codifies Salesforce-specific knowledge that compounds across the team

80% of compound engineering is in **planning and review**. 20% is in **execution**.

- User impact analysis
- Rollback procedures
- Post-deployment verification steps

## Salesforce-Specific Principles

### 1. Governor Limits First
Every code review starts with governor limit analysis. The `apex-governor-guardian` agent validates SOQL queries, DML operations, and heap usage.

### 2. Bulkification by Default
The `apex-bulkification-reviewer` ensures all trigger handlers, batch jobs, and integrations handle collections properly.

### 3. Security in Depth
The security agents validate:
- CRUD/FLS enforcement
- Sharing rule compliance
- Input sanitization
- Lightning Locker compliance

### 4. Test-Driven Development
The `apex-test-coverage-analyst` ensures:
- Positive and negative test cases
- Bulk data tests (200+ records)
- User context tests (different profiles)
- Integration test patterns

### 5. Documentation as Code
Every component gets documented:
- Inline ApexDoc comments
- README files for complex features
- Architecture decision records
- Runbook for operations

## Configuration

### `.sf-compound/config.json`

```json
{
  "org": {
    "defaultOrg": "MyDevOrg",
    "scratchOrgDefinition": "config/project-scratch-def.json"
  },
  "review": {
    "agents": ["all"],
    "excludeAgents": [],
    "severityThreshold": "warning"
  },
  "deployment": {
    "runAllTests": true,
    "testLevel": "RunLocalTests",
    "checkOnly": false
  },
  "patterns": {
    "triggerHandlerPattern": "TriggerHandler",
    "selectorPattern": "Selector",
    "servicePattern": "Service"
  }
}
```

## Integration with Salesforce CLI

The plugin integrates seamlessly with Salesforce CLI commands:

```bash
# Validate before review
sf project deploy validate --target-org MyOrg

# Deploy after approval
sf project deploy start --target-org MyOrg

# Run tests
sf apex run test --target-org MyOrg --code-coverage
```

## Philosophy

### Prefer Explicit Over Magic
Salesforce has enough "magic" (automatic field updates, formula recalculations). Our code should be explicit and readable.

### Fail Fast, Fail Loud
Governor limit exceptions are better than silent data corruption. Design for visibility.

### Test Like Production
200+ record tests aren't optional—they're the minimum. Test with realistic data volumes.

### Security is Not Optional
CRUD/FLS checks, sharing rules, and input validation are requirements, not nice-to-haves.

### Document the Why
Comments should explain business logic, not what the code does. Let the code speak for itself.
