# SF Compound Engineering

**Spec-Driven Development for Salesforce** — A CLI tool to initialize structured development workflows in any Salesforce project.

Similar to GitHub's [`specify init`](https://github.com/github/spec-kit), but with Salesforce-specific commands and best practices.

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize in your Salesforce project (no install required)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git sfce init . --ai claude
```

That's it! You now have:
- **9 slash commands** (`/sf-plan`, `/sf-work`, `/sf-review`, etc.)
- **23 specialized agents** (apex, lwc, automation, integration, architecture)
- **6 skills** (governor-limits, apex-patterns, security-guide, etc.)
- Spec-driven workflow structure
- Salesforce best practices baked in

---

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Using uvx (Recommended)

```bash
# One-time run, no install needed
uvx --from git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git sfce init .

# With Claude Code setup (installs commands)
uvx --from git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git sfce init . --ai claude
```

### Option 2: Permanent Install

```bash
# Install globally
uv tool install git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git

# Then use anywhere
sfce init .
sfce init my-project --ai claude
```

### Option 3: pip install

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/gellasangameshgupta/sf-compound-engineering-plugin.git

sfce init . --ai claude
```

## The Workflow

After initialization, use the commands in sequence:

```
/sf-plan → /sf-work → /sf-review → /sf-triage → /sf-resolve → /sf-test → /sf-document → /sf-health → /sf-deploy
```

| Phase | Command | What It Does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| **Specify** | `/sf-plan` | Generate spec & implementation plan from requirements |
| **Implement** | `/sf-work` | Build following Salesforce best practices |
| **Validate** | `/sf-review` | Multi-agent code review (governor limits, security, patterns) |
| **Prioritize** | `/sf-triage` | Categorize and prioritize review findings |
| **Fix** | `/sf-resolve` | Fix prioritized issues |
| **Test** | `/sf-test` | Generate comprehensive tests (bulk, negative, mocks) |
| **Document** | `/sf-document` | Auto-generate ApexDoc and documentation |
| **Assess** | `/sf-health` | Codebase health check, Go/No-Go decision |
| **Ship** | `/sf-deploy` | Deployment checklist and validation |

---

## Usage Examples

### Start a New Feature

```bash
# Create spec structure
.specify/scripts/create-new-feature.sh lead-scoring

# Generate the plan with Claude
/sf-plan "Build a lead scoring system that calculates scores based on
email opens, web visits, and form submissions"
```

### Review Existing Code

```
/sf-review

Review the AccountTriggerHandler and AccountService classes
for governor limits and security issues.
```

### Generate Tests

```
/sf-test

Generate bulk tests for LeadScoringService with 200+ records.
Include negative tests and mock callouts.
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
sfce init .                    # Initialize in current directory
sfce init my-project           # Create new project and initialize
sfce init . --ai claude        # Set up for Claude Code (installs commands)
sfce init . --ai copilot       # Set up for GitHub Copilot
sfce init . --ai cursor        # Set up for Cursor
sfce init . --force            # Overwrite existing .specify folder
sfce --version                 # Show version
sfce --help                    # Show help
```

| **Automation** | 4 | Flow design, DML in loops, Flow vs Apex decisions |
| **Integration** | 4 | API design, Named Credentials, retry patterns |
| **Architecture** | 4 | Schema design, OWD, anti-patterns |

---

## Skills (6)

Reference documentation that Claude consults automatically:

| Skill | What It Contains |
|-------|------------------|
| `governor-limits` | All Salesforce limits with thresholds |
| `apex-patterns` | Trigger handler, selector, service patterns |
| `security-guide` | CRUD/FLS patterns, injection prevention |
| `lwc-patterns` | Component communication, state management |
| `integration-patterns` | REST, callouts, platform events |
| `test-factory` | TestDataFactory patterns |

---

## Project Principles

The generated `constitution.md` includes Salesforce best practices:

- **Governor Limit Awareness** — All code considers limits, bulk-safe by default
- **Security by Default** — CRUD/FLS enforcement mandatory
- **Separation of Concerns** — Triggers → Handlers → Services → Selectors
- **Testability First** — 80% coverage is baseline, behavior verification required
- **Declarative First** — Flows before Apex when equivalent
